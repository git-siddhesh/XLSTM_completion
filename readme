XLSTM based Point Cloud Completion Network

Requirements:
    - CUDA toolkit 12+ in PATH
    - CUDA 12+ compatible GPU drivers
    - Conda in PATH
    - MVP dataset (as .h5 files in data/) found in https://mvp-dataset.github.io/MVP/Completion.html

The file structure is as follows
    - `dataset.py` contains classes which load the MVP dataset
    - `Models.py` where the core XLSTM based models are used to learn the encoding for the decoder network.
        - 2 encoders are made but the ModelEncoder2 shows slow convergence.
        - XL_Encoder is the active encoder imported in the main file with 2 XLSTM layers consisting of 3 mLSTM layers and 1 sLSTM layer at index 2 
    - `test_xlstm.py` in the main file in the directory which needs to be run.
    - Output models will be saved every epoch and also when the network encounters NAN multiple times
 
To run
Ensure requirements are satisfied
`conda install --file env.yaml`
`conda activate xlstm`
`python test_xlstm.py`
